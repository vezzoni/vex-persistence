The **vex-persistence** API is a high-level library to work above JPA.

The whole API was built with Hibernate implementation of JPA. So, it will be need to add those libraries together on project classpath.
It also can be used with others implementations, like Kodo. But that was not tested.

Feel free to contribute with this project.
